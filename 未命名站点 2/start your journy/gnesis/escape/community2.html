<p>You decided to visit communities around your house because you had to walk, and you didn&rsquo;t want to  make yourself tired. When you were walking along the road in the nearby  community, you suddenly heard a burst of noise, and then following with roar of  people. That was the first time that you headed such noise, and you didn&rsquo;t  know what that noise was. You noticed that many well-dressed people were running in terror  like they were escaping from something. You didn&rsquo;t know what happened, but you  started to run with them. Finally, when you started to feel tired, you were  caught by servants looking for you. You were brough home and for the first time  you were punished by you parents. They forced you to kneel on the floor and  lashed you on your back. You then never left your community later in your childhood.</p>
