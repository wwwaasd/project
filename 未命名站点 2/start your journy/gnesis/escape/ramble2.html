<p>This was the first time that you could go out alone, but you  didn&rsquo;t know where to go. Finally, you decided to ramble around. You had no idea  about where to go so you decided to ramble around. When you were crossing a posh  community around, you noticed that a crowd of people was shouting and running.  They ran past you and you heard a few words &lsquo;rebel&rsquo;, &lsquo;attack&rsquo;, &lsquo;data&rsquo;, and &lsquo;corp.&rsquo;  You didn&rsquo;t know what was going on so you stood still. And then you saw some people  with some black tube-ish things in their hands. Those things sparked fires and  then people fell to the ground, crying with blood going out. You were terrified  and ran away. You went back home safely. After this incident, you were never  allowed to go out alone later in your childhood.</p>
