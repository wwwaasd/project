<p>You decided to visit communities around your house where  were posh parts of the city. Servants led you into the car and drove you along  the road. When you were crossing a community nearby, you suddenly heard a burst  of noise, and then following with roar of people. That was the first time that  you headed such noise, and you didn&rsquo;t know what that noise was. You noticed that servants  had become extremely nervous and terrified. They were driving the car randomly and  ignoring every question you asked, like they were escaping from something. Finally,  you arrived at home. You found that your parents were both nervous and your  mother began to cry once she saw you. You didn&rsquo;t know what happened, but you never  left your community later in your childhood.</p>
