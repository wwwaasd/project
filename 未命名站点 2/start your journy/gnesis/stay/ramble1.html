<p>You had no idea about where to go so you decided to ramble  around. Servants were surrounding you while you were walking. When you were crossing  a posh community around, you noticed that a crowd of people was shouting and  running. They ran past you and you heard a few words &lsquo;rebel&rsquo;, &lsquo;attack&rsquo;, &lsquo;data&rsquo;,  and &lsquo;corp.&rsquo; You didn&rsquo;t know what those meant but you saw servants immediately getting  nervous. You had no chance to react before they took you back home. After this incident, you were never allowed to go out alone  later in your childhood.</p>
